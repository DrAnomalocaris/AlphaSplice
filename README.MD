A web application for searching and visualizing folded proteins of human genes.

## Description

This project provides a platform for users to search for human genes and view detailed information about their folded protein structures. Utilizing interactive search features and a curated database of folded proteins, users can explore gene data, protein structures, and collaborate on further research.

This is only a prototype proof of concept. All the foldings were done in my laptop using [local collabfold](https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold). I would love to set this up in a proper server and running foldings constantly using proper hardware.

## Features

* **Interactive Search Bar** : Autocomplete suggestions for genes and transcripts.
* **Available Folded Proteins List** : Quick access to a list of genes with available folded protein data.
* **Gene Information Pages** : Detailed pages displaying gene-specific data and protein structures.
* **Responsive Design** : User-friendly interface compatible with various devices.
* **Collaboration Opportunities** : Contact information for users interested in contributing.

## Usage

* **Search for a Gene** : Use the search bar at the top of the page to find a gene or transcript. Autocomplete suggestions will help you find the correct gene.
* **View Folded Proteins** : Scroll down on the homepage to see a list of available folded proteins. Click on any gene to view detailed information.
* **Gene Pages** : Explore the gene-specific pages to view protein structures and associated data.
